								<h2>Coding Challenge:<br />

							</header>
							<p>Coding challenge #28 metaballs from the Coding Train refactored to be ojbect oriented.
							This refactoring was to make the current metaballs 'teleport' to another location, this was done by
							adding a function called mouseIsPressed. I used this function because clicking made my refactoring
							easier as I could click anywhere on the canvas to 'teleport' the metaballs.<br/>

							<p>Coding challenge #3 snake game from the Coding Train refactored to be creative.

								<h2>Khan Academy:<br />
								Algorithms</h2>
							</header>
							<p> Explored the world of sorting a lot of things, in different ways too.
							    Learned that there are multiple ways of executing things some of them
							    are better than others. Selection sort is a pretty basic algorithm, you
							    just compare two numbers and sorting from left being the smallest to right
							    right is the largest.

								Intro to JS</h2>

							<p> The basic steps to learn JS were a little annoying but were needed because 
							    it is really important to grasp the basics. This project is "Make it rain" where
							    you use arrays to literally make it rain. My version makes stars rain from a user clicking on the
							    screen.

							<p> A more thorough look on JS after doing the intro. This is a project called
						 	    "Paint Splatter" where you make it look like paint fell off and is making
							    a mess. I used gaussian walkers and normal to make this paint look splattered.

							<p> Beginning of the semester we were experimenting with microbits to see what we were able

							    and another player would do the same. Whoever got the higher number won the match and it would 
							    display a happy and sad face for the winner and loser.
